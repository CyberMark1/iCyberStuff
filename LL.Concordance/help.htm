<h2>How to use the system</h2>
<hr>
<H3>Using Frames - the parts of the window</H3>
Your browser's window is divided into regions called frames.
All the frames can be re-sized: if you let the cursor hover exactly on
the border between two frames, it will change to a re-sizing cursor
which you can drag to reposition the border. 
<p>


<blockquote>
<h3>What the Frames do:</h3>

At the top of the browser's window is the Wordlist Navigator. Click on a letter
 to go quickly to the words beginning with that letter.  If a letter of the alphabet is 
missing from the Navigator, that is because the original text contained no words beginning with
that letter.  If you chose to sort your wordlist by frequency instead of alphabetically 
before building the Web Concordance, the Wordlist Navigator contains links to words 
which occur with a particular frequency instead of words which begin with a particular letter.<P>


At the left of the browser window is the Wordlist, containing an
alphabetic list of all words which are used in the source text.
Clicking on a Headword in the Wordlist will make the Concordance
Frame scroll automatically to display all the instances of that Headword,
together with a line of context for each.
<p>


The Concordance appears in the upper of the two large frames to the right of the Wordlist. If you
have clicked on a Headword in the Wordlist frame, the Concordance
Frame will have scrolled automatically to that Headword.
Beside each Headword is a count of the number of times it occurs,
and below it are all the actual occurrences, each in a line of context.
To the right of each context line are References. Clicking on a Reference
will make the Text frame scroll automatically to display the
relevant part of the source text.
<p>

The text from which the concordance was made appears in the lower of the 
two large frames to the right of the Wordlist. 
You can use the scroll bars to move around in the text.  Clicking on a
Reference in the Concordance frame will make the Text frame scroll
automatically to display the relevant part of the source text.
<p>

<h2>Hints: how to get more text on screen at a time</h2>
A Web Concordance puts a lot of text onto the screen. You may find yourself wishing
you could see more text at once and had to scroll around less.
<p>
There are several ways to improve things:
<ul>
<li> Turn off the bits of your browser which you don't need.  Unnecessary toolbars and buttons
use screen space.
<li>Choose a smaller font.
<li> Re-size the frames so that the one you want to see more of is larger. All the
frames can be re-sized: if you let the cursor hover exactly on the border between two
frames, it will change to a re-sizing cursor which you can drag to reposition the border.
</ul>

<a name="search"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Searching for a word</h2>

The Wordlist navigator in the top frame is a quick way of
scrolling the Wordlist frame and the Concordance frame to words beginning
with the letter you want.  From there you can browse, using the frame's scroll
bars, to find the word you want.  (If you have chosen to sort your wordlist by frequency 
instead of alphabetically, the Wordlist navigator contains links to words which occur 
with a particular frequency instead of words which begin with a particular letter.)


<p>
You can also use your browser's Find button to carry out any search.
The search will happen in the frame you last clicked in.  To let the system
find a word for you in a single operation, first load the entire Wordlist
(see <a href="#morecontrols">More Wordlist controls</a>), then press
the Find button.

<p>
The Find button will also work for searches in the Text frame and the
Concordance frame, but bear in mind that only one section of the Text or
the Concordance may be loaded at any one time, so searches with the Find
button will be confined to that section.<p>

<H3>Control buttons in the Wordlist, Concordance, and Text frames </H3>

If the Web Concordance was built with images for links, you will see these:
<img align=middle width=34 height=35 src="tsfngdn2.gif" alt="down">
and <img align=middle WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=35 src="tsfngup2.gif" alt="up">
take you to the next and previous lines in the Wordlist, the
Concordance, or the source text, loading another section to do so. <p>

<img align=middle width=32 height=32 src="prev_3.gif"> and
 <img align=middle width=32 height=32 src="next_3.gif">
 take you backwards and forwards through the Wordlist, Concordance, or Text a
section at a time.
<P>
<img align=middle width=40 height=40 src="go_top_b.gif" alt="top of section">
moves you to the top of the current section of the Wordlist, Concordance, or Text.
<p>

<A HREF="#Top of page"><IMG width=60 height=20 SRC="top.gif" ALT="Top of page"></A>

<a name="morecontrols"></a>
<hr>
<H2>More Wordlist controls</H2>
At the top of the Wordlist you will see either the
<IMG align=middle width=53 height=25 SRC="tslink3.gif"> button or the
<IMG align=middle width=57 height=25 SRC="tszig3.gif"> button.  They are opposites in
their effect. <p>

<IMG align=left width=53 height=25 SRC="tslink3.gif"> This button appears at the top of a
section of the Wordlist when only one section of the Wordlist is loaded.
Pressing it will cause the entire Wordlist to be loaded at once.
Loading the entire Wordlist makes searching easier, since searches
are otherwise confined to the loaded portion; but it will probably slow
down other aspects of your browser's performance.
<p>

<IMG align=left width=57 height=25 SRC="tszig3.gif"> This button appears at the top of a
section of the Wordlist when the entire Wordlist is already loaded.
Pressing it will cause a single section of the Wordlist to be loaded
instead.  Loading the Wordlist a section at a time will speed up most aspects
of your browser's performance, but will mean that searches for words
in the wordlist will be confined to the loaded portion.
